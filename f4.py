While trying to check what happens during form_blob, I discovered the following:

It's called 5 times until an exception, but the iteration inside for index, _seg in enumerate(fork_):is never hit until the last one, where seg doesn't have enough elements.
When that iteration is hit, I tried to see what's inside seg and discovered that it's so huge that it can't be printed, it hangs there and if waited enough it breaks with "Memory Error" as early as the [1] element, only [0] is "normal"
len(_seg)=4

    frame() is my core algorithm of levels 1 + 2, modified for 2D: segmentation of image into blobs, then search within and between blobs.
    frame_blobs() is frame() limited to definition of initial blobs per each of 4 derivatives, vs. per 2 gradients in current frame().
    frame_dblobs() is updated version of frame_blobs with only one blob type: dblob, to ease debugging, currently in progress.

    Each performs several levels (Le) of encoding, incremental per scan line defined by vertical coordinate y, outlined below.
    value of y per Le line is shown relative to y of current input line, incremented by top-down scan of input image,
    prefix '_' denotes higher-line variable or pattern, vs. same-type lower-line variable or pattern,
    postfix '_' denotes array name, vs. same-name elements of that array:

    1Le, line y:    x_comp(p_): lateral pixel comparison -> tuple of derivatives ders ) array ders_
    2Le, line y- 1: y_comp(ders_): vertical pixel comp -> 2D tuple ders2 ) array ders2_ 
    3Le, line y- 1+ rng*2: form_P(ders2) -> 1D pattern P ) P_  
    4Le, line y- 2+ rng*2: scan_P_(P, _P) -> _P, roots: down-connections, fork_: up-connections between Ps 
    5Le, line y- 3+ rng*2: form_segment: merge vertically-connected _Ps in non-forking blob segments
    6Le, line y- 4+ rng*2+ segment depth: form_blob: merge connected segments into blobs

    These functions are tested through form_P, I am currently debugging scan_P_. 
    All 2D functions (y_comp, scan_P_, etc.) input two lines: higher and lower, convert elements of lower line 
    into elements of new higher line, and displace elements of old higher line into higher function.
    Higher-line elements include additional variables, derived while they were lower-line elements.

    Pixel comparison in 2D forms lateral and vertical derivatives: 2 matches and 2 differences per pixel. 
    They are formed on the same level because average lateral match ~ average vertical match.
    Each vertical and horizontal derivative forms separate blobs, suppressing overlapping orthogonal representations.
    They can also be summed to estimate diagonal or hypot derivatives, for blob orientation to maximize primary derivatives.
    Orientation increases primary dimension of blob to maximize match, and decreases secondary dimension to maximize difference.

    Subsequent union of lateral and vertical patterns is by strength only, orthogonal sign is not commeasurable?
    Initial input line could be 400 for debugging, that area in test image seems to be the most diverse
