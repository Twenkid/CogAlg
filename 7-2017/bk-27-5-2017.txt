Todor Arnaudov:

Also, I may have mentioned this, an idea about a "natural" incremental raster that is rather radial with more adjacent directions and with gradually diminishing effect/weight.

If not many-directions, for example hexagons: https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/82362/what-are-the-benefits-of-hexagonal-sampling-polygons

The radial raster may be generated as mapping from the standard square/rectangular raster, and resampled when visualized.

An advantage of the radial representation is that all adjacent pixels are at the same distance to the central one ("the focus"), thus the diagonal artifacts/irregularity of the 3x3 raster quadrants are eliminated.

Also, that assists in the more natural (to me) initial incremental scanning to all six  directions (without diagonal artifact) and there would be 6 smooth 1D.

The horizontal/vertical dimensions (lines) get discovered as they are met most often, fit more cheaply during the mapping and as a part of the "orthogonality", which is a specific property of vectors > 1D.

B.K. "One that did was that initial patterns should defined by 2D gradient, simply because average match is equal in both dimensions. 
Actually, this just justification is mine, his was intuitive. That's a deviation from core algorithm, but makes sense for images. 
So, I am revising level 1 into a mixture of 1D and 2D, starts from "or": https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GElEvTlwwshZl1Z8KYetMoCPGxfJzq7zKC8G2rll160/edit?usp=sharing
Levels 2 and above would have to be redefined too."

T.A.:

Good that you're exploring different paths. As of the dimensions (I may have shared these thoughts, not sure): 


Have you considered radial sampling - hexagons or higher resolution circle of pixels: 

https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/82362/what-are-the-benefits-of-hexagonal-sampling-polygons 

As of being "incremental", such representation provides equal distance between the focus/central pixel and all its neighbors, while in the rectangular raster there's a diagonal artifact.

{

  Although for rect. sampling in image processing that's compensated with appropriate coefficients/longer distance for the diagonal for the convolution kernels as for gaussian blur.

}

It shouldn't matter in the long run of the algorithm and for resolutions which are high enough, however conceptually equal distances seem more "natural".
(For lines in-between two hexagons - it's 0.5*A1 + 0.5*A2.

Also, it is incremental if the algorithm searches for dimensions in "rays" (it doesn't know that the input is 2D) and eventually converges/selects horizontal/vertical scanlines due to the patterns in the input and with the discovery of "orthogonality", a property of 2D vectors.

In a RECT Cartesian coordinate system, orthogonality is built in.


 


More importantly, I need to formalize level 4 feedback, especially coordinate feedback, to re-define the whole process on it's own. 
That should make the algorithm "self-modifying", and then it's just a matter of cycles.
Still, the first 4 levels must be defined manually.

Regarding compression ration, initially there might be losses

Radial growth?

I also think that initially regions  have more material for locally-emerging unsupervised processing for a general case (a variety of "patterns", forming "spectra"). For one single central input or quadrant gradient/or 3x3 region there's no spectrum and "everything is a pattern".
